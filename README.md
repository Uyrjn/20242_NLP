# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) with BERT and T5

## Project Overview

This project focuses on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using transformer-based models such as BERT and T5. The goal is to identify aspect terms in sentences and classify their corresponding sentiment polarities (positive, negative, neutral).

We use the **SemEval 2014 Task 4** dataset, which contains restaurant and laptop reviews annotated with aspect terms and sentiment labels.

## Dataset

- **Source:** SemEval 2014 Task 4 â€“ Laptop and Restaurant Reviews
- **Language:** English
- **Annotations:**
  - Aspect terms with their positions in sentences.
  - Sentiment polarity labels (positive, negative, neutral) for each aspect term.

## Folder Structure


- The `/model` folder contains the trained models.
- The `/data` folder contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- The `/src` folder contains all source code.

## Pre-trained Models
